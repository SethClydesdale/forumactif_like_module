# Forumotion Like Module

The purpose of this plugin is to improve the base reputation system by :

1. Count Positive and Negative votes
2. Submit votes and update the count asynchronously without changing pages
3. Provide an easy to customize plugin

To install the module, simply navigate to your administration panel and go to **Modules > JavaScript codes management**. After that, just create a script with placement only in the topics. The CSS should go into your stylesheet of course.

A more indepth tutorial will be made soon, but the result should be similar to the image below.
